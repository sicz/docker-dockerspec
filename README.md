- Official [Alpine Linux image](https://store.docker.com/images/alpine) as base system
- Modular [Docker entrypoint](https://github.com/sicz/docker-entrypoint)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) provides Docker command line tools
- [RSpec](http://rspec.info) provides Ruby testing framework
- [ServerSpec](http://serverspec.org) provides server testing framework for RSpec
- [DockerSpec](https://github.com/zuazo/dockerspec) provides Docker pluging for ServerSpec
- `bash` as shell
- `ca-certificates` contains common CA certificates
- `curl` for transferring data using various protocols
- `jq` for JSON data parsing
- `libressl` for PKI and TLS
- `runit` for service supervision and management
- `su_exec` for process impersonation
- `tini` as init process

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Clone GitHub repository to your working directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sicz/docker-dockerspec
```

### Usage

Use command `make` to simplify Docker container development tasks:
```bash
make all        # Destroy running container, build new image and run tests
make build      # Build new image
make refresh    # Refresh Dockerfile
make rebuild    # Build new image without caching
make run        # Run container
make stop       # Stop running container
make start      # Start stopped container
make restart    # Restart container
make status     # Show container status
make logs       # Show container logs
make logs-tail  # Connect to container logs
make shell      # Open shell in running container
make test       # Run tests
make rm         # Destroy running container
```

## Deployment

At first init RSpec configuration for your project:
```bash
docker run \
  -v ${PWD}:/root \
  -w /root \
  --rm \
  sicz/dockerspec --init
```
and create your tests in `spec` directory. For inspiration you can look at our
Docker projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/sicz).

With [sicz/Mk](https://github.com/sicz/Mk) you can test your Docker image with
simple command:
```bash
make test
```
